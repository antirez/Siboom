Siboom is a simple markup system for writing books drafts.

The idea is to have a very simple format to write book drafts that it is trivial
to convert into something prettier. Currently available filters are able to
turn Siboom files into HTML or plain text, a Latex output filter is under
development.

Please check the example.siboom file to get a feeling of the markup and
features.

USAGE

In order to see it at work just try the following:

    siboom.rb example.siboom html > example.html

And open example.html with your browser.
Instead to generate plaintext try the following:

    siboom.rb example.siboom txt > example.txt

WRITING A NEW OUTPUT FILTER

To write a new output filter is trivial, you have to write a self contained
Ruby class that is able to do things like list_start, list_end, emit_text,
and so on. Check the HTML filter and use it as reference to write your new
output filter.
